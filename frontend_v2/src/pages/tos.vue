      </p>
      <p>
        This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This
        license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these
        restrictions or the Terms of Service, and may be terminated by
        Bellingcat at any time.
      </p>
      <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
      <p>
        You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over content you
        submit to us for publication on our website. We will never claim
        ownership of your content but we do require a license from you in order
        to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use our website or its associated services to post, upload,

      </p>
      <p>
        The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting your
        content or account. However, to the extent that we (or our partners)
        have used your content in connection with commercial or sponsored

      </p>
      <p>
        You give us permission to use your username and other identifying

      <h3>Liability</h3>
      <p>
        Our website and the materials on our website are provided on an 'as is'

        conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or
        non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no event shall Bellingcat or its suppliers be liable for any
        consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party
        arising from the use or inability to use this website or the materials
        on this website, even if Bellingcat or an authorised representative has
        been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the context of this agreement, &ldquo;consequential loss&rdquo;
        includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss
        of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of
        goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss

        contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied
        warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

      <p>
        This acceptable use policy covers the products, services, and
        technologies (collectively referred to as the &ldquo;Products&rdquo;)
        provided by Bellingcat under any ongoing agreement. It’s designed to
        protect us, our customers and the general Internet community from
        unethical, irresponsible and illegal activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bellingcat customers found engaging in activities prohibited by this
        acceptable use policy can be liable for service suspension and account
        termination. In extreme cases, we may be legally obliged to report such
        customers to the relevant authorities.
      </p>
      <p>This policy was last reviewed on 15 June 2023.</p>
      <h3>Fair use</h3>
      <p>
        We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be
        &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;, as per our offer schedule. If your use
        is considered to be excessive, then additional fees may be charged or
        capacity may be restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights
        infringement and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group,
        individual or resource. We expect our customers and, where applicable,
        their users (&ldquo;end-users&rdquo;) to likewise engage our Products
        with similar intent.
      </p>
      <h3>Customer accountability</h3>
      <p>
        We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as
        well as for the actions of anyone using our Products with the customer’s
        permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone using our
        Products on an unauthorised basis as a result of the customer’s failure
        to put in place reasonable security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence
        to this policy on behalf of anyone using the Products as their end
        users. Complaints regarding the actions of customers or their end-users
        will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a
        result of the customer — violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve
        the right to terminate any Products associated with the offending
        account or the account itself or take any remedial or preventative
        action we deem appropriate without notice. To the extent permitted by
        law, no credit will be available for interruptions of service resulting
        from any violation of our acceptable use policy.
