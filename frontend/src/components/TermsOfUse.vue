    customers and the general Internet community from unethical, irresponsible

  <h3>Fair use</h3>
  <p>

    may be restricted.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights infringement
    and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group, individual or

    (&ldquo;end-users&rdquo;) to likewise engage our Products with similar
    intent.
  </p>
  <h3>Customer accountability</h3>
  <p>
    We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as well

    If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a result
    of the customer — violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve the right
    to terminate any Products associated with the offending account or the
    account itself or take any remedial or preventative action we deem
    appropriate without notice. To the extent permitted by law, no credit will
    be available for interruptions of service resulting from any violation of
    our acceptable use policy.
